  B. Unexpected unacceptable side effects                        AEISSUE
  C. No emerging trends and no reasonable chance of 
     demonstrating benefit                                       UNLIKELYBENEFIT
2.  Based on overall progress of the trial:

  A. Data from other trials establishing unequivocal treatment

  B. Data from clinical practice indicating unsuspected and
     unacceptable treatment side effects
  C. Developments superseding current treatment
  D. Treatment withdrawal from the market (Pulled from market)  
  E. Supply chain
4.  Personnel Issues (Principal Investigator change)             PERSONNEL
5.  Regulatory, inadequate risk benefit, review committee,

7.  Ambiguity in why_stopped                                     UNKNOWN
8.  Words indicating trial completion                            COMPLETED
9.  Business reasons                                             STRATEGIC
